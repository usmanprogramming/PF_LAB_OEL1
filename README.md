## Task 1: Online Shopping Cart

**Objective:**  
Simulate a small shopping cart where a customer can buy items based on the money they have.

**Features:**

- Displays a list of items with prices.
- Allows the customer to select items multiple times.
- Checks if the customer has enough money for the selected item.
- Deducts the cost from the available money and confirms the purchase.
- Stops when the customer chooses to checkout or runs out of money.
- Displays the remaining balance at the end.

**Concepts Used:**  
Arrays, loops, conditionals, user input.

## Task 2: Delivery Management System

**Objective:**  
Simulate a simple food delivery system where a customer can order items, calculate the total bill, and apply delivery charges.

**Features:**

- Displays a menu of items with prices.
- Takes the customer’s item choice and quantity.
- Calculates the cost and adds it to the total bill.
- Applies free delivery if the total bill is above 1000; otherwise, adds a delivery fee of 150.
- Allows the customer to place multiple orders.
- Shows the final bill clearly at the end.

**Concepts Used:**  
Arrays, loops, conditionals, arithmetic operations, user input.
